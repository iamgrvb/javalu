Q1. What is a compiler?
Solution : Compiler is a computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., Java,C++) 
into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer's CPU. 
Compilers are very large programs, with error-checking and other abilities.

What is an interpreter?
An interpreter is a program that executes instructions written in a high-level language.
Interpreters enable other programs to run on a computer or server. They process program code at run time, checking the code for errors line by line.
An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language 
without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Python.

Q2. Define a class Student with following members:
int roll, String name, float marks.
input() to take input of the details
display() to all details of a student.
Write a program to which will store details of a student and print the details using the above

Solution: public class Student
{
    private String name;
    private int roll;
    private float marks;
    
    public void input() {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter student name: ");
        name = in.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Enter roll: ");
        roll = in.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter marks: ");
        marks = in.nextInt();
    }
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Roll: " + roll);
        System.out.println("Marks " + marks);
        
    }
    
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Student obj = new Student();
        obj.input();
        obj.display();
    }
}
