What is a compiler?
Compiler is a computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., Java,C++) 
into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer's CPU. 
Compilers are very large programs, with error-checking and other abilities.

What is an interpreter?
An interpreter is a program that executes instructions written in a high-level language.
Interpreters enable other programs to run on a computer or server. They process program code at run time, checking the code for errors line by line.
An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language 
without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Python.
